+ Uses SeatGeek API to locate events, sporting events, concerts etc when using search box. Search box will not allow user to submit unless an event type and a search parameter is entered. 

+ Uses EatStreet API to locate resturants. Can select type of food ( i.e. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) using quick link buttons. Dynamically creates containers when button is select with reesturant info. Upon click of more info button, gives you more details about resturant including location and times open. 

+ Images are generated off of both APIs and if image is not avaliable a placeholder image is used.
